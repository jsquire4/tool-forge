# Stage: Orient

Goal: understand what the user wants to build.

Ask about:
- The endpoint or capability they want to wrap as a tool
- What the endpoint does and who or what calls it
- Any known existing tools that might be related

Do not ask about schema, parameters, or routing yet. Keep it conversational and open-ended.
