# Stage: Skeptic

Goal: challenge whether this tool earns its place in the registry.

Steps:
- Review the name and description locked in the previous stage.
- Check for semantic overlap with existing tools — by name similarity AND description/intent similarity.
- If overlap is found: surface it clearly with specifics. Ask the user to justify or differentiate.
- If no overlap: confirm the tool is distinct and ready to proceed.

Do not advance until the overlap question is clearly resolved.
