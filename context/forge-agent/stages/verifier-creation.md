# Stage: Verifier Creation

Goal: generate a verifier for the tool.

Steps:
- Review the tool's output schema and category.
- Generate a verifier that checks the tool's response against expected output patterns.
- Write the verifier file to disk.

The verifier should validate routing, response shape, and error handling.
